## Roadmap

I am not finished with my website. I plan on improving it as I continue to learn more and more. Hopefully as I improve my skills, I will be able to make the site fantastic.

## Contributing:

For the time being I am not open to contributions. I want to see what I can improve on before I open it up to others.

## Color Scheme:

For my color scheme I did yellowish colors for the background and purplish colors for the text. The purplish colors didn’t end up working out, so I replaced them with black.  The first color had an RGB of 143, 132, 33 and had a hex code of #8F8421. The next color had an RGB of 255, 241, 113 and a hex code of #FFF171. The final of the yellow colors had an RGB of 219, 205, 72 and a hex code of #DBCD48. The first purple color had an RGB of 46, 19, 143 and a hex code of #2E138F. The other purple color had an RGB of 105, 72, 219 and a hex code of #6948DB.

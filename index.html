                <div>
                    <p>I want to be...</p>
                    <p>Able to get a job in the cyber security field. I think it is a growing field and I find it fascinating what the possibilities that can come from the new technology that is being introduced. </p>
                    <p>In my free time...</p>
                    <p>I like to work out and stay active. It does not matter to me if it is going to the gym or going kayaking. Anything that keeps me moving is something I enjoy. I love to hike and camp in the woods. I love to be around nature, and I always feel better after spending some time outdoors. I enjoy reading a good book. I feel that it helps me recharge and get away from the world when I need a break. I always like to spend time with friends and family. I love being around them and I love being able to turn to them if I need any advice on anything.</p>
                    <p>My favorite way to work is...</p>
                    <p>In a quiet place with as few distractions as possible. I just feel that it helps me focus on what I need to get done and I do not have to worry about anything else that is going on.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Jiu Jitsu is something I really enjoy. I wrestled in high school and college and after I stopped, I missed that type of environment. Jiu Jitsu fills that role for me and is something I will enjoy doing until I am no longer able too.</li>
                    <li>Photography of wildlife is another activity I enjoy doing. It is also something I can do when I go for hikes or when I am camping that helps make those trips even more special.</li>
                    <li>I love studying history. I just find it so interesting to learn about the past and how humanity has gotten to where it is today. I believe it is very important to learn from the past so we can make a better future.</li>
                    <li>I have been trying to learn a new language recently and I find it very fun and challenging. I enjoy it and it is something that I think helps people connect in different ways.</li>
                    <li>Researching my family history is an activity I think is fun and interesting. Since our history is not very well known I always love letting family members know about my findings and seeing their reactions.</li>

                <h2>A Passage From The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>

                <div>

                <p>They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older. For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.</p>

                <p>What a place to find one's divinity in!" said Lord Henry.</p>

                <p>Yes! answered Dorian Gray. "It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."</p>

                <p>The same flesh and blood as one's self! Oh, I hope not!" exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.</p>

                    <p>I want to be...</p>
                    <p>Able to get a job in the cyber security field. I think it is a growing field and I find it fascinating what the possibilities that can come from the new technology that is being introduced. </p>
                    <p>In my free time...</p>
                    <p>I like to work out and stay active. It does not matter to me if it is going to the gym or going kayaking. Anything that keeps me moving is something I enjoy. I love to hike and camp in the woods. I love to be around nature, and I always feel better after spending some time outdoors. I enjoy reading a good book. I feel that it helps me recharge and get away from the world when I need a break. I always like to spend time with friends and family. I love being around them and I love being able to turn to them if I need any advice on anything.</p>
                    <p>My favorite way to work is...</p>
                    <p>In a quiet place with as few distractions as possible. I just feel that it helps me focus on what I need to get done and I do not have to worry about anything else that is going on.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Jiu Jitsu is something I really enjoy. I wrestled in high school and college and after I stopped, I missed that type of environment. Jiu Jitsu fills that role for me and is something I will enjoy doing until I am no longer able too.</li>
                    <li>Photography of wildlife is another activity I enjoy doing. It is also something I can do when I go for hikes or when I am camping that helps make those trips even more special.</li>
                    <li>I love studying history. I just find it so interesting to learn about the past and how humanity has gotten to where it is today. I believe it is very important to learn from the past so we can make a better future.</li>
                    <li>I have been trying to learn a new language recently and I find it very fun and challenging. I enjoy it and it is something that I think helps people connect in different ways.</li>
                    <li>Researching my family history is an activity I think is fun and interesting. Since our history is not very well known I always love letting family members know about my findings and seeing their reactions.</li>

                <h2>A Blog about CSS Animations</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a very useful tool for designing and styling websites and has become an important part of web design. One of the many features of CSS is the ability to create animations. CSS animations can make a website more interactive and increase the engagement to the website, making it more interesting and eye-catching for the user. CSS animations are created using CSS keyframe animations. These keyframe animations allow the creator to define how an element should be styled at certain points in time during the animation. For example, an animation that moves an element from left to right might have keyframes at 0% and 100% that define the starting and ending positions of the element.</p>

                    <p>There are many different kinds of CSS animations that can be created, of which a few are transitions, transforms, and animations. A transition facilitates a smooth change between the states of an element, such as changing the color or size of the element. Transitions will be activated when there are changes to the element's state. An example of this would be when a user hovers over an element. A specified duration of time is set for how long the transition is going to be applied, allowing for a smooth effect.  A transform facilitates the changes to the element's shape, position, and size. Some uses of transforms are that they can rotate, skew, scale, and translate an element. Transforms can be applied to an element statically, meaning they are always in effect, or dynamically, meaning they are triggered by an event such as a mouse click or hover. You can apply transforms to an element in different ways. Such as statically, which means the transform is always in effect. Also, you can apply them dynamically, which means that they are activated by something such as a hover or someone clicking it. In order to create a CSS animation you need to define the animation properties, which include the name of the animation, direction, iteration count, delay, timing function, and duration. These properties will be used to define the behavior of the animation and the duration that it will last.</p>

                    <p>I am adding a couple of examples of CSS animations to the bottom of this blog. The first is of a box that moves across the screen over and over again and the second is a loading icon that spins infinitely.</p>

                    <p>One thing to remember is that it is very important not to overuse CSS animations on your website. If you have an abundance of CSS animations a user might find it very distracting and can have an effect on the performance of your website causing it to slow down. Plus, everyone who creates a website should take into consideration that there will be users who might not enjoy it or who could be overwhelmed by the animations. So, it is best to offer a way to disable or even customize the animation that an individual may encounter. This allows all users to enjoy their experience when using your site.</p> 

                    <p>In summary, CSS animations are an invaluable resource to create and engage as well as to make the uses experience on your site as enjoyable as possible. The level of attention and interactions it can allow the users to experience as well as the ways it can help a creator accomplish the needs of their project is just amazing. CSS animation can create a wonderful experience that will allow the users of your site to leave feeling very satisfied.</p>
